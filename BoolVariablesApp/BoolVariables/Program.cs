//Bool is complete either True or Fale (Boolean)
bool isComplete = !true;   //be mindful of casing - variable assinged lower case but result has upper case T

//isComplete = !false ;   
// using the ! = so even though the result typed is false by adding ! gives True. Does not modify the original variable
Console.WriteLine(isComplete); 
Console.WriteLine(!isComplete);    //does not modify the original variable
